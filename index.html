    <h1>Computer Science and Design Project Portfolio</h1>
    <p>These are the projects that I have completed over this past school year. We started off very simple and ended up making games and graphs with our own data and even really amazing art.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="box">Computer generated art</div>
      <p> This project was made to show what I had learned during our javascript graphics. This program allows you to choose if you want a lot of fish in the sky or in the water or if you want the title. If you say yes than there will be between 10 and 20 fish instead of 1 through 10. This allows for customization of this graphic. The fish are also placed in random positions. So, if you're interested, click run and see what it looks like.</p>

      <div class="box">Evasion Game</div>
      <p> We made this game for the final project of the keystrokes and animation units. In this game you are Walt (controlled with mouse) and are trying to avoid your DEA cousin Hank and trying to collect your money. Be careful though, when you get more money, more hanks spawn in to try and catch you. Be careful of the middle because that's where hanks spawn and they have no mercy. Go play it, see if you can beat my high score of 41.</p>

      <div class="box">Data Tracking Project</div>
      <p> This project was meant to teach us about data visualization. We made a form and had to fill it out every day until we had enough data to stop. Then, we had to make graphs in observable, google sheets, and codehs. After that, we had to make some form of content showing our graphs and I chose to make a YouTube video. Right below is the video, check it out if you want. </p>

      <div class = "box">History Video</div>
      <p>This is a video a couple of friends and I made for history. This was ending our unit on ancient Judea where we learned about the roman Judea conflict and how christianity started. In this project, we were told to break up into groups and film a video. In this video, we were told to each represent one faction that played a role in the defense against the romans and why the jews lost and the temple was destroyed. My friend edited the video so if you like it, credit goes mostly to him. If you want to learn a little history watch it. No pressure though. </p>
